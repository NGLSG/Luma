## üìñ Overview & Design Philosophy

The core goal of the Luma Engine is to provide 2D game developers with a development platform that combines ultimate performance with a modern workflow. We adhere to the following design principles:

- **Data-Driven**: Everything in the engine (scenes, entities, components, animations) is data. This makes hot reloading, editor extensions, and procedural content generation extremely simple.
- **Modularity & Extensibility**: Each core system of the engine (rendering, physics, audio, etc.) is a highly decoupled module, facilitating independent upgrades, replacements, or extensions.
- **Performance First**: From the choice of ECS architecture to the design of the JobSystem, every decision prioritizes performance.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NGLSG/Luma.git
cd Luma
```

### Environment & Dependencies

Before starting the build, please ensure your system environment and all dependencies are correctly configured.

#### 1. Prerequisites

Please ensure you have installed the following system-level libraries and tools:

*   **Git**
*   **CMake** (Version **3.21** or higher)
*   **Vulkan SDK**
*   **LibCurl**
*   **OpenSSL**
*   **C++ Compiler** (e.g., Visual Studio 2022 / GCC 11 / Clang 14)

> **Note**: Dependencies like LibCurl, OpenSSL, and the Vulkan SDK can be installed using package managers, e.g., `apt` on Ubuntu, `vcpkg` or `choco` on Windows.

#### 2. Download Dependencies

All third-party libraries need to be placed in the `External` folder at the project root. Please follow these steps:

**Step 1: Create the `External` Directory**

If the `External` directory does not exist, create it in the project root.

```bash
mkdir External
cd External
```

**Step 2: Clone Source Repositories**

Clone all the following libraries into the `External` directory.

| `llama-cpp`           | `https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git`        |
| `SDL`                 | `https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git`             |
| `yaml-cpp`            | `https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git`            |

You can use the following script to clone all repositories at once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/astc-encoder.git
git clone https://github.com/erincatto/box2d.git
git clone https://github.com/skypjack/entt.git
git clone https://github.com/g-truc/glm.git
git clone https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git
git clone https://github.com/thedmd/imgui-node-editor.git
git clone https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo.git
git clone https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git
git clone https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git
```

**Step 3: Download and Extract Binary Dependencies**

`CoreCLR` and `Skia` are provided as precompiled binary packages.

1.  Go to the [Luma-External Releases](https://github.com/NGLSG/Luma-External/releases/tag/Prebuilt) page.
2.  Download the corresponding `.zip` package for your operating system. For example, Windows users need to download `skia-win.zip` and `coreclr-win-x64.zip`.
3.  **Extract** the downloaded `.zip` files into the `External` directory.

| Binary Package   | OS              | Download File             |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------ |
| `coreclr`        | Linux (x64)     | `coreclr-linux-x64.zip`   |
| `coreclr`        | Windows (x64)   | `coreclr-win-x64.zip`     |
| `skia`           | Linux           | `skia-linux.zip`          |
| `skia`           | Windows         | `skia-win.zip`            |

**Step 4: Configure Dependency Build File**

This is a crucial step. You need to **move** the `ExternalCMakeLists.txt` file from the project **root directory** to the `External` directory and **rename** it to `CMakeLists.txt`.

Execute the following command in the project **root directory**:

```bash
# For Linux / macOS / Git Bash
mv ExternalCMakeLists.txt External/CMakeLists.txt

# For Windows CMD
# move ExternalCMakeLists.txt External\CMakeLists.txt
```

After completing the above steps, your `External` directory structure should look like this:

```
Luma/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ External/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt      <-- File moved and renamed from root
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ astc-encoder/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ box2d/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coreclr-win-x64/    <-- Extracted directory
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entt/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ glm/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ imgui/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other cloned libs)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skia-win/           <-- Extracted directory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other project files)
```

### üîß Building the Luma Engine

With all dependencies ready, you can build the project using CMake.

Execute the following commands in the project root directory:

```bash
# 1. Create a build directory and enter it
mkdir build
cd build

# 2. Run CMake to configure the project
cmake ..

# 3. Start the compilation
# On Windows (Visual Studio), this generates a .sln file; open it in VS to build
# On Linux (Makefiles), you can directly run the build command
cmake --build .
```

After successful compilation, the executable will be located in the corresponding subdirectory within the `build` directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Systems Deep Dive

<details>
<summary><strong>üì¶ Asset & Resource System</strong></summary>

Luma employs a modern asset pipeline based on **GUIDs**. All source files in the `Assets/` directory are automatically processed, generating a `.meta` file containing a unique ID and import settings. At runtime, the `AssetManager` efficiently loads resources from disk or retrieves them from the cache based on the GUID, ensuring stable and efficient resource referencing.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Source File .png] --> B{TextureImporter} --> C[Meta File .meta]
    C --> D{AssetManager}
    E[Game Systems] --> D
    D --> F{Runtime Cache}
    F --> G[Runtime Resource SkImage]
    D --> H[Loader] --> G
    G --> E
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>‚ú® Visual Blueprint System</strong></summary>

It not only provides an intuitive node editing experience but also eliminates the performance bottlenecks of traditional visual scripting by **directly generating C# source code**.

- **Workflow**: `Visual Blueprint Editing` -> `Save as .blueprint file` -> `C# Code Generator` -> `Generate .cs script` -> `Participate in project compilation` -> `Run at native performance`
- **Features**: Supports events, branches, loops, custom functions/variables, calling any external C# function, logic region comment boxes, and more.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>‚ö° Physics & JobSystem</strong></summary>

Physics simulation is based on **Box2D**, running in an independent loop with a **fixed timestep**, ensuring deterministic results. To handle interactions between a large number of physics objects, the physics world step calculation is encapsulated into a Job and distributed across multiple cores for parallel processing by the **JobSystem**, significantly improving performance.

The JobSystem itself is based on a **work-stealing** algorithm, efficiently handling various balanced and unbalanced parallel computing tasks, and already provides a complete **C# API**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üé¨ Animation, Tilemap, UI & Audio</strong></summary>

- **Animation State Machine**: Provides a powerful visual editor to create and manage 2D animation states (Idle, Run, Jump, etc.) and their transition conditions, easily controlled via C# API.
- **Tilemap System**: Similar to Unity's Tile Palette, supports standard, rule tiles, and even allows **Prefabs** to be used as brushes to paint game objects containing complex logic.
- **UI System**: Built on ECS, provides core components like `Text`, `Image`, `Button`, `InputText`, with support for `ScrollView` planned.
- **Audio System**: Based on **SDL3**, provides a high-performance audio manager supporting 3D spatial sound and dynamic multi-channel mixing.
